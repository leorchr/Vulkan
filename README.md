# Vulkan Model Loader

## Overview
This repository provides an example implementation of a Vulkan-based 3D model loader. It utilizes **GLFW** for window management, **Assimp** for loading 3D models, and supports texture loading directly from the model files.

## Features
- Loads 3D models using **Assimp**
- Uses **GLFW** for window creation and input handling
- Supports **texture loading** from model files
- Renders models using **Vulkan**
- Basic pipeline setup for displaying textured 3D objects
